# ScatterX
We developed ScatterX program for processing time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering 2D image data efficiently. Users can obtain parameters like gyration radius, fractal dimension, porosity with ease. It enables data extrapolation and solving complex functions like distance distribution, particle size distribution.
